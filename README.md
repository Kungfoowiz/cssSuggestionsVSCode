# cssSuggestions README

CSS suggestions for Properties and Values.

## Features

Main features of the extension:

Press colon ‘:’ to get CSS properties, scroll and click desired property.

After typing a property, press colon ‘:’ to get available CSS values.

Hover the colour property to get VS Code’s integrated colour picker.

Made this to get similar functionality that we get in Visual Studio Pro/Community edition.
